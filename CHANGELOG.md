# Changelog

All notable changes to MNEMOS are documented here.

## [4.2.0a14] — 2026-05-01

Pre-release alpha consolidating five overnight waves of work
between 2026-04-30 and 2026-05-01: NATS multi-replica federation
+ webhook receivers, partial-outage test infrastructure, latent
bug fixes (RLS SQL, pool acquire timeouts), Accept-header content
negotiation, MCP get_memory format parameter, /metrics auth gate,
path-traversal hardening across MCP tools, TimeoutPool wrap, and
an OpenAPI-export CLI for Custom GPT / Actions consumers.

A single ``v4.2.0a14`` tag bundles work from a2 through a14;
intermediate alphas were tagged but not released. Release notes
group by area rather than by intermediate version.

### Added

- **NATS multi-replica receivers (`a8`)**: queue-group sharding
  on JetStream consumers so federation + webhook receivers scale
  horizontally without duplicate processing.
- **Live-broker integration test harness (`a9`,
  `tests/integration_nats/`)**: ``ManagedBroker`` fixture spawns
  a real ``nats-server`` per test, with ``--server_name=<uuid>``
  identity check that rejects port-race squatters; partial-
  outage tests drive the production ``consumer_loop`` reconnect
  + backoff path against true broker restarts. Skips cleanly
  when no ``nats-server`` binary is present.
- **Federation feed compressed-variant payloads (`a14`)**: new
  ``GET /v1/federation/feed?prefer_compressed=true`` query
  param emits the winning ``memory_compressed_variants`` row in
  place of raw content when the variant is strictly smaller on
  the JSON wire (gated via Postgres ``to_json(text)::text``
  exact-byte measurement). Bytes-on-wire reduction up to 4–6×
  for variant-bearing memories. v3.6 charter §2.5 surface 1.
- **Accept-header content negotiation on
  ``GET /v1/memories/{id}`` (`a14`)**:
  - ``Accept: text/plain`` → prose narration body (same as
    ``/v1/memories/{id}/narrate?format=prose``).
  - ``Accept: application/x-apollo-dense`` → raw winning-
    variant content (same as ``?format=dense``).
  - Default (``application/json``, ``*/*``, missing) → existing
    JSON ``MemoryItem``.
  ``Vary: Accept`` set on every representation so caches do not
  conflate types. Both branches honour the same
  ``VisibilityFilter.for_read`` contract — federated / world /
  group-readable memories are returned identically across
  Accept values. v3.6 charter §2.5 surface 2.
- **MCP ``get_memory`` ``format=prose|dense`` (`a14`)**: stdio
  + HTTP-SSE MCP clients can request the compressed variant
  representations through the same content-negotiation paths
  the HTTP API exposes. v3.6 charter §2.5 surface 3.
- **``MNEMOS_METRICS_REQUIRE_AUTH`` (`a14`)**: optional Bearer-
  token gate on ``/metrics``. Default off (network-scope
  convention preserved). When enabled, the request must carry
  a valid Bearer token from an ``api_keys`` row whose owning
  user has ``role='root'``; non-root keys return 403,
  unknown / revoked keys return 401, and a settings-read
  failure fails closed (503).
- **``mnemos dump-openapi`` CLI (`a14`)**: emits the FastAPI
  OpenAPI spec without booting the server. ``--output PATH``,
  ``--indent N`` (0..8), ``--title T`` overrides, and
  ``--target {full|gpt-actions}``. The ``gpt-actions`` target
  truncates endpoint summary/description fields to 300 chars
  and parameter description fields to 700 chars per OpenAI's
  Custom GPT Actions production limits, so the artifact
  imports cleanly into a Custom GPT or OpenAI Actions bridge.
  v4.1 connector deliverable.
- **``mnemos doctor`` CLI (`a13`)**: pure-stdlib accelerator
  detection (NVIDIA CUDA / Tegra, Intel iGPU, Apple Silicon)
  that names the recommended ``mnemos-os[ml|gpu|phi]`` extra.
- **Connector documentation gallery (`a13–a14`)**: per-surface
  Markdown guides (``docs/connectors/{claude-code,cursor,
  codex-cli,continue-dev,cline}.md``) with mechanically-
  verified config snippets. Canonical MCP tool surface table
  in the README enumerates 18 tools with R/W classification
  and the ``kg_``-prefix asymmetry called out (``kg_create_triple``
  has the prefix; ``update_triple`` / ``delete_triple`` do
  not). The ``mnemos_`` UI prefix some agents add (Cursor's
  tool drawer) is documented as display-only.
- **Memory architecture design paper
  (``docs/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md``, `a13`)**: 3000-word
  description of identity, provenance, version DAG,
  compression/synthesis, federation, persistence, and
  observability.
- **Operator observability guide
  (``docs/OBSERVABILITY.md``, `a13`)**: Prometheus scrape
  config, the live metric set, optional metrics auth, and the
  shipped Grafana dashboard
  (``docs/observability/grafana/mnemos-overview.json``).
- **TimeoutPool proxy wrap (`a14`)**: wraps the asyncpg pool
  at lifecycle creation so the 86+ legacy ``_lc._pool.acquire()``
  call sites inherit ``DEFAULT_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT`` uniformly,
  without per-site migration. The distillation worker's pool
  also routes through ``wrap_pool_with_timeout`` at start +
  reconnect.
- **``mnemos.core.pool.is_infrastructure_error`` predicate
  (`a14`)**: distinguishes pool / connection-loss class
  errors (asyncio.TimeoutError + asyncpg connection family)
  from content / processing failures, used by the compression
  worker's broad-except handlers to avoid converting pool
  pressure into terminal MARK_FAILED rows.
- **Compression queue infra-retry semantics (`a14`)**: when
  the worker hits a pool / connection error, the affected
  rows are reset to ``status='pending'`` with ``attempts``
  decremented (``GREATEST(attempts - 1, 0)``) and an
  ``error='infra_retry: ...'`` breadcrumb. The stale-running
  sweep refuses to terminalize rows whose ``error`` is
  ``NULL`` or starts with ``infra_retry:`` regardless of
  ``attempts``, so sustained pool pressure cannot terminalize
  a content-OK row. ``counts['infra_errors']`` is the new
  telemetry bucket.
- **MNEMOS_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE write-stamp (`a13`)**: MCP
  create/search/list/bulk tools stamp the configured
  namespace on writes. Documented as a write-stamp / search-
  filter ergonomic, NOT enforced isolation; root keys cross.
- **Profile-aware ``require_postgres_pool_or_503`` helper +
  67-site migration sweep (`a14`, rounds 53-60)**: every
  Postgres-only route now emits a profile-aware 503 detail
  that names the route AND tells operators to set
  ``MNEMOS_PROFILE=server`` (or ``MNEMOS_PERSISTENCE_BACKEND
  =postgres + a working PG_*``) to enable the route. The old
  bare ``Database pool not available`` detail conflated
  "this route is Postgres-only-by-design" with "the pool is
  transiently down" — operators on edge profiles chased
  phantom outages. 67 call sites across 14 modules
  (journal, ingest, sessions, portability, providers, oauth,
  dag, document_import, kg, webhooks, versions,
  consultations, memories, admin, federation) migrated onto
  the canonical helper. ``oauth_me`` keeps a non-raising
  ``if cookie_session and _lc._pool:`` fallback because it
  short-circuits to a personal/api-key response rather than
  raising; documented in
  ``tests/test_postgres_only_503_invariant.py``.
- **AST invariant pins the bare-503-shape (`a14`,
  round-61)**: ``tests/test_postgres_only_503_invariant.py``
  bans the bare ``if not _lc._pool: raise HTTPException(503,
  "Database pool not available")`` shape across
  ``mnemos/api/routes/`` and asserts ``require_postgres_pool
  _or_503`` is called from ≥20 sites — a future regression
  to the bare shape trips a unit test before code review.
- **Document-import transactional outbox + HTTP status
  surfacing (`a14`, rounds 47-50)**: per-chunk ``async with
  conn.transaction():`` wraps the memory INSERT and
  ``_dispatch_webhook(conn=conn)`` so the delivery row joins
  the same transaction (corpus-review-2026-04-29 #2 closure).
  Single-file ``POST /v1/import/document`` returns 207 Multi-
  Status when ``errors`` is non-empty + 502 Bad Gateway when
  every chunk failed on a retryable infra fault; multi-file
  ``POST /v1/batch-import`` aggregates per-file
  ``status_code`` into a top-level 207 (mixed) or 502
  (every per-file ``status_code == 502``) so HTTP-status-
  only clients see partial / full failure even when the
  body is JSON.
- **AST invariant: every dispatch call passes ``conn=``
  (`a14`, round-52)**:
  ``tests/test_dispatch_outbox_invariants.py`` AST-walks
  every call to ``mnemos.webhooks.dispatcher.dispatch``
  (and aliased imports) and fails if any call is missing
  the ``conn=`` keyword — the transactional-outbox guarantee
  that the delivery row joins the caller's transaction.
- **``mnemos dump-openapi --server-url`` (`a14`,
  round-51)**: Custom GPT / OpenAI Actions consumers can
  now bake the deployment hostname into the spec at export
  time (``servers: [{url: ...}]``) rather than patching by
  hand post-export. ``--target gpt-actions`` deep-copies the
  cached FastAPI ``app.openapi()`` dict before mutation so
  the per-CLI-invocation server override doesn't bleed into
  pytest fixtures.
- **OpenAI Custom GPT connector doc (`a14`, round-42)**:
  ``docs/connectors/openai-custom-gpt.md`` covers Custom GPT
  Actions setup against ``mnemos dump-openapi --target
  gpt-actions``: spec generation, Bearer-auth wiring,
  endpoint description / parameter description limits.
- **Claude Desktop connector doc (`a14`, round-44)**:
  ``docs/connectors/claude-desktop.md`` fills the previously
  broken README link with stdio + HTTP/SSE recipes.
- **Connector-doc config validation tests (`a14`,
  round-46)**: ``tests/test_connector_doc_configs.py``
  mechanically parses every fenced JSON block in
  ``docs/connectors/*.md`` and fails the suite on a config
  that won't parse. Surfaced two pre-existing broken-JSON
  bugs in ``continue-dev.md`` and ``claude-desktop.md``
  (placeholder ``...existing...`` / ``... ...`` syntax that
  never parsed); both fixed in the same commit.
- **MNEMOS_NODE_NAME hostname-fallback warning (`a14`,
  round-39)**: when ``MNEMOS_NODE_NAME`` is unset and the
  NATS connect helper falls back to ``socket.gethostname()``,
  one WARNING line is logged the first time so operators
  see the fallback explicitly. Subsequent connects stay
  silent (one-shot ``_NODE_NAME_FALLBACK_LOGGED`` flag).
  NATS-corpus-review-V4.2 finding #9 closure.
- **NATS payload sensitivity + ACL guidance
  (``docs/NATS_OPERATIONS.md``, `a14`, rounds 40-41,
  corrected round-45)**: per-subject sensitivity table
  documents that JetStream nudges carry only memory IDs
  (not bodies); bodies are fetched via authorized HTTP feed.
  Sample ACL configs for ``mnemos-server`` (pub/sub) vs
  ``mnemos-observer`` (subscribe-only) vs federation peer
  scope-tight pattern. NATS-corpus-review-V4.2 findings
  #10, #11.

### Fixed

- **document_import retry-safety arc (`a14`, rounds 62..68)**:
  the round-54..60 503-helper sweep dropped a stub route_label
  on ``import_memories_from_document``; codex caught it in
  round-61 review, then surfaced six progressively-deeper
  problems over rounds 62..67 before round-68 closed the loop
  with a real schema-level idempotency primitive. The full arc:
  - **round-62**: per-caller ``route_label`` (single-file vs
    batch); batch endpoint pre-loop pool check so SQLite/edge-
    profile 503s escape uncaught with the correct top-level
    status. Pool check precedes Docling-availability check.
  - **round-63**: aggregator surfaces top-level 503 if ANY
    per-file is 503 (so a mid-batch pool drop doesn't hide
    behind a 207 body). Helper wraps acquire to convert
    asyncpg/asyncio.TimeoutError to HTTPException(503,
    route_label).
  - **round-64**: helper returns ``(payload, 503)`` preserving
    committed-chunks ``memory_ids`` on infra failure instead of
    raising bare HTTPException(503).
  - **round-65**: ``unconfirmed_memory_ids`` field surfaces
    in-flight chunk IDs whose INSERT was accepted but commit-
    ack was lost. Retry-aware clients query
    ``GET /v1/memories/{id}`` to reconcile.
  - **round-66**: documentation revised — a single 404 on the
    reconciliation read is NOT a safe rollback oracle under
    Postgres MVCC; three operator-honest retry options
    documented in DOCUMENT_IMPORT_GUIDE.md.
  - **round-67**: deferred-primitive section corrected —
    ``ON CONFLICT (...) DO NOTHING RETURNING id`` returns 0
    rows on conflict, NOT the existing row's id. Two viable
    shapes (DO UPDATE no-op SET vs two-step INSERT-then-SELECT)
    documented with their trade-offs.
  - **round-68**: ships the full primitive — migration
    ``migrations_v4_2_document_import_chunk_idempotency.sql``
    adds ``import_chunk_key`` (sha256 of owner_id+namespace+
    source_file+chunk_num with NUL separators) and a partial
    UNIQUE index. Helper switches to ``ON CONFLICT
    (import_chunk_key) DO UPDATE SET import_chunk_key =
    EXCLUDED.import_chunk_key RETURNING id`` and trusts the
    RETURNING value as the canonical id. Postgres serializes
    the conflict path against the prior in-flight transaction,
    so commit-ambiguous retries are now safe — ``new_memory_id
    ()`` remains the surrogate but the canonical id is whatever
    came back from RETURNING. The no-op SET fires the AFTER
    UPDATE trigger, but ``mnemos_version_snapshot()`` only
    writes a new ``memory_versions`` row when audited fields
    are IS DISTINCT — ``import_chunk_key`` is not in that
    audited set, so retry-conflicts produce zero version-row
    churn.
- **LATENT BUG: ``SET LOCAL <name> = $1`` SQL on RLS-enabled
  Postgres (`a14`)**: PostgreSQL ``SET`` syntax does NOT
  accept bind parameters (per the official docs). The
  ``maybe_set_pg_rls`` helper and the parallel ``_rls_context``
  in ``mnemos/api/routes/memories.py`` had been using this
  shape since at least v3.0. The bug was latent because the
  live deployment runs ``MNEMOS_RLS_ENABLED=false``; the day
  someone flipped RLS on, every authenticated read would have
  500'd with a Postgres syntax error before the protected
  query ran. Both call sites now use ``SELECT
  set_config('<name>', $1, true)``.
- **Path-traversal across MCP / Knossos / KG tool surfaces
  (`a14`)**: caller-controlled ``memory_id`` / ``commit_hash``
  / ``triple_id`` / ``drawer_id`` / ``subject`` values
  spliced into REST paths could escape the
  ``/v1/memories/`` (and similar) prefix via httpx dot-
  segment normalization. With the new ``_rest_get_text``
  helper returning raw text, this widened to an
  exfiltration vector for any text endpoint
  (e.g. ``/metrics``). Validation + URL-encoding helpers
  ``_safe_path_segment`` (strict alphanum + ``_:-`` whitelist
  for IDs; admits documented federated id grammar
  ``fed:<peer>:<remote>``) and ``_safe_path_value`` (looser
  whitelist for free-form fields like KG entity names; rejects
  ``..`` traversal + URL-rewrite chars) applied at every
  splice site across ``mnemos/mcp/tools/{memory,dag,kg}.py``
  and ``mnemos/tools/knossos_mcp.py``.
- **Compression worker turning pool pressure into terminal
  failed rows (`a14`)**: pre-fix, every post-dequeue
  ``Exception`` ran ``MARK_FAILED``. After the round-28
  TimeoutPool wrap, asyncio.TimeoutError reached that
  handler and converted transient pool pressure into
  permanent failed compression rows. Eight-round
  iterative fix split infrastructure errors from content
  errors, reset un-processed batch tails before re-raising,
  unified all post-dequeue infra exit paths through one
  tail-reset site, and rewrote the stale-running sweep to
  refuse terminalization without a recorded content-error
  breadcrumb.
- **MORPHEUS / DAG endpoints (`a13`)**: cross-namespace
  telemetry leak on MORPHEUS read endpoints and DAG read /
  visibility skew with memory CRUD already-fixed in
  ``v4.1.3``; v4.2.0a14 verifies the pre-existing fixes.
- **Federation peer URL validation aligned with webhook SSRF
  policy (`v4.1.3`)**: peer registration runs through the
  same private-IP / metadata-host validator as webhooks.
- **Connector documentation honesty (`a12–a13`)**: 5 connector
  doc files refactored after 12+ rounds of codex review
  caught doc-overstating-code patterns: enforced isolation
  (which is not enforced; docs now say "write stamp"); per-
  key ``default_namespace`` (no such column; namespace lives
  on ``users``); CLI shape (real CLI is
  ``mnemos serve mcp-stdio``, not ``mnemos mcp serve --stdio``;
  endpoint is ``/sse``, not ``/v1/mcp/sse``); SSH inline-env
  caveat (``env VAR=val cmd`` is not shell-safe for tokens
  with metacharacters); MCP tool-name registry asymmetry
  (kg_create_triple has the prefix; update_triple /
  delete_triple do not — autoApprove takes the bare name).
- **fastembed semantic-similarity scoring (`a12`)**: the
  ``QualityAnalyzer`` previously called ``model.encode()``
  on fastembed which silently returned 85.0 for every pair.
  Switched to ``model.embed([text1, text2])`` returning an
  iterator of ndarrays. Added a ``-1.0`` sentinel for failed
  embeddings + a ``HEURISTIC_ONLY_CAP=70`` so high-trust
  task types cannot auto-approve from heuristic-only signal.
- **Heuristic compression auto-approve floor (`a12`)**:
  approve threshold dropped from 100 to 70 when no semantic
  signal is available, so a memory cannot reach
  ``approved`` purely on heuristics.

### Changed

- **psycopg dropped from default install (`a12`)**: psycopg's
  LGPL-licensed transitives don't fit MNEMOS's
  Apache/MIT/BSD/MPL closure. asyncpg-only by default;
  installer's ``create_api_key`` falls back through asyncpg
  → psycopg → psycopg2 → ``psql`` CLI when the optional
  shim is installed.
- **psutil + spacy removed from default deps (`a12`)**: zero
  imports across ``mnemos/``; both unused since the v4.0
  refactor.
- **torch removed from required deps (`a12`)**: heavyweight
  ML deps moved behind opt-in extras
  (``mnemos-os[ml|gpu|phi]``); fastembed (Apache-2.0,
  ~20MB) replaces sentence-transformers (which depended on
  torch). ``mnemos doctor`` recommends the right extra
  per host accelerator.
- **/narrate endpoint visibility (`a14`)**: lifted to
  ``VisibilityFilter.for_read`` so federated / world /
  group-readable memories render identically to the JSON
  ``GET /v1/memories/{id}`` path. RLS context (``SET LOCAL
  ...``) applied inside the transaction to match the JSON
  path's defense-in-depth.

### Operational

- **No-op for v4.1.3 deployments**: every change in this
  alpha is additive or replaces internal mechanism without
  changing the existing on-the-wire contract. The federation
  feed ``prefer_compressed`` query, MCP ``format`` parameter,
  Accept-header dispatch, and dump-openapi CLI are all
  opt-in.
- **Variant write-time wire-byte measurement
  (``federation_feed``)**: the byte gate uses
  ``2 * octet_length(to_json(v.compressed_content)::text)``
  vs ``octet_length(to_json(m.content)::text) +
  COALESCE(octet_length(to_json(m.verbatim_content)::text), 0)``.
  ``to_json(text)::text`` returns the exact JSON-escaped
  serialization Postgres emits on the wire, so the gate is
  conservative without false positives on control-character-
  heavy content.

## [4.2.0a1] — 2026-04-30

NATS JetStream substrate alpha — first slice of the v4.2 MQ work
chartered in `project_mnemos_graeae_mq_design.md`. Additive only:
existing webhook outbox remains the durable delivery path.

### Added

- `mnemos/nats/` package: `connect_nats`, `ensure_streams`,
  `publish_event`, `get_jetstream`. Fail-open — if NATS is
  unreachable or `MNEMOS_NATS_URL` is unset, publishing is a silent
  no-op.
- `MNEMOS_MEMORY` JetStream stream declared on startup. Subjects
  `mnemos.memory.created.<namespace>`, `…updated.…`, `…deleted.…`.
  File-backed, 30-day retention, 10 GB cap, 2-min duplicate window.
- `MNEMOS_NATS_URL` + `MNEMOS_NATS_TOKEN` settings (typed
  `_NatsSettings`).
- `memory.created` events now publish to NATS in addition to the
  transactional webhook outbox. `Nats-Msg-Id` header set to
  `<memory_id>.created` for idempotent re-publishes.
- Hatchet workflow-engine integration deferred to v4.2.0a2.

## [4.1.3] — 2026-04-29

Corpus-review hardening release.

### Fixed

- Pinned webhook delivery DNS resolution from validation through HTTP connect to close DNS-rebinding SSRF.
- Moved consultation completion and DAG live-merge webhooks into the transactional outbox path, with delivery scheduled only after commit.
- Released GRAEAE provider concurrency slots in `finally` during cancelled fan-out.
- Marked sessions, entities, state, and MORPHEUS HTTP routes as Postgres-only on edge profiles with explicit 503 responses.
- Restricted MORPHEUS run telemetry reads to root/operator callers.
- Migrated route-level asyncpg acquires to `PoolManager.acquire()`.
- Aligned DAG read preflight with memory read visibility while keeping branch/merge writes strict-owner scoped.
- Applied webhook SSRF URL validation to federation peers; private peer URLs require `FEDERATION_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true`.
- Added typed `AuthSettings` and server-profile fail-closed auth defaults via `MNEMOS_AUTH_ENABLED`.
- Made SQLite duplicate explicit memory IDs raise `DuplicateMemoryError` instead of silently succeeding.

## [4.1.2] — 2026-04-29

GRAEAE provider-routing fix + container-env operations standard.

### Fixed

- `mnemos.domain.graeae.engine._ranked_candidates` tiebreak ordering
  added an explicit non-reasoning preference between `last_synced` and
  `len(model_id)`. Before this fix, the `len()` fallback accidentally
  promoted `-reasoning` SKUs (shorter names) over `-non-reasoning`
  siblings of equal weight/version, so xAI Grok consultations came
  back tagged with `\confidence{N}` blocks instead of clean text.
  Provider helper `_is_reasoning_variant(model_id)` formalizes the
  classification.
- New regression suite at `tests/test_graeae_ranked_candidates.py`
  covers the helper + the tiebreak ordering.

### Operational

- v4.x container env standard documented: every `mnemos serve`
  container MUST mount `~/.api_keys_master.json` →
  `/etc/mnemos/api_keys.json` (read-only) AND set
  `MNEMOS_KEYS_PATH=/etc/mnemos/api_keys.json`. The v4.1.1 cutover
  surfaced that without these, GRAEAE quietly falls back to
  empty-key/no-provider state and every consultation 401s.
- Pre-existing reasoning-variant rows in `model_registry` should be
  marked `deprecated=true` for Grok-family providers via:
  `UPDATE model_registry SET deprecated = true WHERE provider = 'xai'
   AND model_id ~ '-reasoning$' AND model_id NOT LIKE '%non-reasoning'`.
  v4.1.2 fleet rollout includes this UPDATE on PYTHIA + CERBERUS
  before container restart.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-29

Major refactor + multi-backend persistence + multi-worker support release.

### Added

- Persistence abstraction (`PersistenceBackend` ABC) plus SQLite implementation
  using sqlite-vec / FTS5 / JSON1 / WAL.
- Deployment profiles: server (Postgres + Redis + multi-worker), edge
  (SQLite single-worker), dev (SQLite + DEBUG).
- Multi-worker support via Redis-backed circuit breaker / rate limiter /
  concurrency limiter; in-process fallback preserved.
- Single-binary distribution via pyinstaller for linux-x86_64,
  linux-aarch64, macos-aarch64 with sqlite-vec bundled.
- Unified `mnemos` CLI: serve / install / worker / export / import /
  consult / health / version.
- 7 import-linter contracts enforce package boundaries in CI.
- Pydantic Settings singleton replaces 105 ad-hoc `os.environ.get` calls;
  CI bans `os.environ` outside `core.config` + `installer`.
- 3 new GRAEAE reasoning modes: single, debate, majority.

### Changed

- Codebase restructured into `mnemos/` package (`api/routes` / `core` / `db` /
  `domain` / `mcp` / `webhooks` / `workers` / `hooks` / `installer` / `tools` /
  `cli`).
- `portability.py` (2679 LOC) split into 10 focused files + repository
  layer; route file is now 82 LOC.
- `openai_compat.py` (1366 LOC) -> 7 focused files; route file 270 LOC.
- `mcp_tools.py` (1278 LOC) -> 6 per-domain modules.
- `webhook_dispatcher.py` (1748 LOC) -> 11 modules per concern.
- `workers=1` pin removed; multi-worker safe with Redis.

### Fixed

- GRAEAE empty-body bug (HTTP 200 + 0 bytes on short prompts under
  `arch_design` with no mode field).
- Unknown mode values now 422-rejected (was silent fallthrough).

## [3.5.1] — 2026-04-28 (doc-triage patch)

Documentation and version-state reconciliation only. No product behavior
changes from v3.5.0.

### Changed

- Bump package/runtime version metadata from 3.4.1 to 3.5.1.
- Reframe README, deployment, specification, API, roadmap, evolution, and
  release-charter docs around the shipped v3.5.x state.
- Preserve historical LETHE / ANAMNESIS / ALETHEIA references, but remove or
  reframe current-state docs that still described retired compression engines,
  `CompressionManager`, the `DistillationEngine` compatibility wrapper, or
  vestigial session compression columns as active.
- Surface shipped v3.2-v3.5 features in user-facing docs: two-dimensional
  owner+namespace tenancy, MORPHEUS, recall tracking, MPF portability,
  CHARON schema preflight, webhook retry leases/outbox hardening, MCP registry
  parity, faithful OpenAI-compatible gateway handling, PostgreSQL streaming
  replication doctrine, and namespace-uniform audit closure.

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-28

v3.5.0 is the audit-driven hardening and uniform-tenancy release. It shipped
the branch sequence that began after v3.4.1: session-history ordering,
memory-read tenancy and DAG integrity, webhook retry hardening, RLS
group-select parity, the federation compound-cursor tie-breaker, consultation
audit endpoint scoping, MCP transport parity, faithful OpenAI-compatible
gateway controls, namespace-uniform tenancy across remaining product surfaces,
bulk webhook parity, and the single-site PostgreSQL streaming-replication
doctrine.

### Added

- **Shared read-visibility helper** — `api/visibility.py` now owns
  `read_visibility_predicate` (`api/visibility.py:40-96`),
  `version_visibility_predicate` (`api/visibility.py:99-137`),
  `_assert_target_head_visible` (`api/visibility.py:140-168`),
  and `handle_trigger_pgerror` (`api/visibility.py:24-37`).
- **Trigger replacement migration** —
  `db/migrations_v3_5_trigger_same_memory_parent.sql` replaces
  `mnemos_version_snapshot()` so UPDATE/DELETE resolve branch HEADs
  under lock, fail closed on missing/NULL/foreign heads with SQLSTATE
  `MN001`, and keep the DELETE tombstone path live.
- **RLS group-select policy migration** —
  `db/migrations_v3_5_rls_group_select_unix_bits.sql` replaces
  `mnemos_group_select` so RLS uses Unix group-read bit math
  (`((permission_mode / 10) % 10) >= 4`), matching
  `read_visibility_predicate` and closing #25.
- **Docker existing-volume upgrade path** — `docker-compose.yml` and
  `docker-compose.staging.yml` now include a one-shot
  `postgres-upgrade` service that applies v3.5 database patch
  migrations after Postgres is healthy. This is required because
  `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` only runs when a volume is first
  initialized.
- **Regression coverage** — new slice-2 tests cover branch visibility,
  cross-memory DAG guards, visibility gaps in logs, trigger concurrency
  locking, `MN001` update/delete conflict mapping, version tenancy, and
  migration-list sync. The merged branch reports 768 passing tests.

### Changed

- **Slice 13 Phase-1 audit closure.** Internal categorization managers now
  require caller context and scope state, journal, and entity CRUD by
  `owner_id + namespace`; memory-created webhook delivery rows are enqueued in
  the same transaction as the memory insert; unknown chat-completion models now
  return OpenAI-style `404 model_not_found`; stale session compression columns
  are dropped by a new v3.5 migration; deployment docs and templates now state
  the v3.5 single-worker runtime contract.
- **Memory read surfaces use one predicate.** `list_memories`,
  `get_memory`, search, rehydrate, and gateway context now share the
  owner/federated/world/group-readable predicate. The Redis search
  cache key serializes raw inputs with `json.dumps(..., separators=...)`
  and includes group IDs so `None`, empty string, and group variation
  cannot collide.
- **History reads are per-snapshot.** `list_versions`, `get_version`,
  `diff_versions`, HTTP DAG log/get-commit/merge paths, and MCP
  log/checkout/diff paths gate each `memory_versions` row by the
  snapshot's own `owner_id`, `namespace`, and `permission_mode`.
  `memory_versions` lacks `group_id` and `federation_source`, so the
  version predicate intentionally fails closed for those historical
  cases.
- **DAG writers serialize on branch identity.** `merge_branch` and
  feature-branch `revert_memory` share `_branch_advisory_lock_key`
  (`api/handlers/dag.py:21-40`) and use advisory-lock-before-row-lock
  discipline. Main-branch revert still updates the live memory row
  through the trigger under the main GUC; feature-branch revert is a
  pure DAG insert.
- **Branch creation is race-safe.** HTTP and MCP branch creation lock
  the parent memory row with `FOR SHARE`, resolve the starting snapshot
  after the lock, and insert with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING`.
  MCP implicit-HEAD retries are idempotent; explicit `from_commit`
  retries must match the existing head.
- **Merge writes target tenancy.** Merge commits copy content and
  provenance from the source snapshot but owner/namespace/permission
  from the target branch head; drift guards compare all versioned
  fields including tenancy before mutating live main.
- **Branch logs do not bridge hidden history.** Recursive log walks are
  same-memory only, and `parent_hash` is emitted only when the actual
  immediate parent is also visible.
- **Session history order fixed.** Slice 1 returns the most recent
  history messages instead of the oldest, with deterministic system-row
  pinning.
- **Project URLs moved.** `pyproject.toml` metadata points at
  `mnemos-os/mnemos`.
- **Legacy compatibility shims removed.** Federation cursors are compound-only,
  webhook recovery assumes current writer rows (`writer_revision=1`), session
  creation no longer accepts `compression_tier`, and the ARTEMIS compression
  path no longer exposes the `DistillationEngine` compatibility wrapper.
  Search helpers also use the full read-visibility predicate whenever
  `owner_id` is supplied instead of preserving the owner/federation-only
  fallback for omitted `group_ids`.
- **Slice 9 HA replication doctrine** — single-site deployments now document
  PostgreSQL streaming replication as the canonical HA path: one writable
  primary, read-only standbys, WAL shipping, and a stable writer endpoint for
  MNEMOS. Federation stays first-class, but is reserved for genuinely remote
  scenarios such as multi-site deployments, multi-org curated feeds, developer
  laptop replicas with intermittent connectivity, and planned v4 SQLite-based
  local-replica profiles.
- **Slice 12 — compression semantics** — drop session-layer always-NULL
  `compression_ratio` fiction columns from `session_messages` +
  `session_memory_injections`; document operator-batched compression doctrine in
  `docs/COMPRESSION.md`. Real compression layer
  (`memory_compression_queue`, `memory_compression_candidates`,
  `memory_compressed_variants`, `StatsResponse`, `RehydrationResponse`, admin
  batch endpoints) unchanged.
- **Namespace-uniform product surfaces.** State, journal, entities, sessions,
  and GRAEAE consultations now carry the same owner+namespace discipline as
  memory rows. Entity uniqueness is widened to
  `(owner_id, namespace, entity_type, name)`; state keys are scoped by
  `(owner_id, namespace, key)`.
- **Bulk memory create webhook parity.** `POST /v1/memories/bulk` now emits
  `memory.created` through the same transactional outbox path as single
  memory creation for every successful item and rolls back the batch if outbox
  enqueue fails.

### Fixed

- **Slice 8 OpenAI-compatible gateway honesty (#5/#6/#7)** —
  `/v1/chat/completions` now propagates `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and
  `top_p` through GRAEAE into provider payloads; supports OpenAI-format
  SSE when `stream=true`; accepts string or content-block message payloads;
  and passes tools/tool_choice, response_format, stop/n, and penalties only
  where the selected provider can honor them. Unsupported provider/field
  combinations now return explicit HTTP 400s instead of being silently
  dropped. `/v1/models/{model_id}` now returns 404 for unregistered models,
  and model discovery no longer synthesizes `owned_by="Unknown"` entries.
- **Slice 7 MCP split-brain (#24)** — `api/mcp_tools.py` is now the
  canonical MCP tool registry for stdio and HTTP/SSE transports. The live MCP
  surface includes CRUD, bulk create, stats, KG tools, DAG log/branch/diff/
  checkout, and `recommend_model`, with registry parity tests pinning both
  transports. HTTP/SSE now supports `MNEMOS_MCP_TOKENS=user:api_key` per-user
  bearer issuance and logs a WARNING when legacy shared `MNEMOS_MCP_TOKEN`
  mode would collapse clients onto one backend identity.
- **Slice 6 consultation audit endpoint scoping (#22)** —
  `/v1/consultations/audit` now returns only the caller's consultation audit
  rows for non-root users, while root retains the global operational view.
  `/v1/consultations/audit/verify` now scopes non-root verification to the
  caller's own consultation audit rows and keeps full-chain verification for
  root. Existing consultation detail and artifact routes are pinned by
  regression tests to return 404 for another user's consultation IDs.
- **Slice 5 round-2 search compression probe cleanup** — large
  `/v1/memories/search` result sets no longer call the retired
  distillation backend health check or log misleading "compression
  disabled" telemetry. The live compression path remains the
  queue-driven APOLLO/ARTEMIS contest and its persisted variants.
- **Federation feed cursor tie-breaker** — `/v1/federation/feed` now
  paginates with an opaque cursor carrying both `updated` and `id`, filters
  with `(m.updated > cursor_updated OR (m.updated = cursor_updated AND
  m.id > cursor_id))`, and orders by `m.updated ASC, m.id ASC`. The puller
  decodes the cursor for the next page while persisting the existing
  timestamp cursor column, so no schema migration is required. Feed servers
  are compound-cursor-only; malformed or missing cursors start an initial
  fetch from the beginning.
- **Webhook retry replay state machine** — `api/webhook_dispatcher.py:121-146`
  now recovers due `pending` rows plus `retrying` rows only when no
  successor attempt exists. Superseded attempts use
  `status='abandoned'` plus `superseded=TRUE`, while final failures keep
  `superseded=FALSE`; `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_superseded_marker.sql`
  adds the audit marker and converts rows from the pre-round-8 branch-only
  terminal state. `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_attempt_unique.sql` adds a
  live partial unique index on `(subscription_id, event_type, payload_hash,
  attempt_num)`, and successor inserts now use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
  RETURNING` after an in-transaction successor recheck.
  `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_retry_terminal_state.sql` repairs existing
  superseded `retrying` rows with `abandoned`.
  Round 3 replaces the long-held `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` send lock with
  `lease_token` / `lease_expires_at` persisted claims in
  `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_attempt_lease.sql`, so DNS validation and
  outbound HTTP no longer hold shared DB connections. It also caps active
  sends per process, gates recovery claims and successor inserts
  with a per-chain advisory lock, and runs a startup repair burst before
  backing off to periodic repair sweeps. Operators must drain webhook
  writers before applying the v3.5 webhook retry migrations during rolling
  upgrades. Round 4 derives one wall-clock send deadline from
  `WEBHOOK_LEASE_SECONDS`, reserves a finalize buffer, wraps DNS validation,
  the HTTP POST, and the response-body read in that deadline, and streams
  response bodies into a fixed audit cap so a slow receiver cannot outlive
  the lease or hold a semaphore slot indefinitely. Round 5 anchors each send
  timeout to the DB-returned claim timestamps instead of a fresh static
  budget, and sends `Accept-Encoding: identity` on webhook POSTs as the first
  response-compression defense. Round 6 switches
  webhook lease/expiry SQL from transaction-snapshot `NOW()` to
  `clock_timestamp()`, reads audited response bodies through `aiter_raw()` and
  rejects non-identity response encodings before decompression, and adds
  `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_writer_revision.sql` so current-writer rows are
  explicitly stamped with `writer_revision=1`. Round 7 adds
  `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_status_updated_at.sql`, a trigger-maintained
  status-transition timestamp for audit and repair observability. Round 9 relaxes the
  idempotent repair sweep so out-of-order `pending`/`retrying` overwrites of an
  already superseded attempt are terminalized again whenever a newer successor
  exists. Round 10 splits retry repair and delivery recovery into independent
  lifespan tasks so slow webhook POSTs cannot starve the repair cadence, and
  makes the repair predicate skip rows with an unexpired lease so active
  new-worker sends do not lose ownership. Round 11 moves the app-side send
  deadline anchor inside `_claim_delivery` immediately before the lease UPDATE,
  makes lease-valid success finalization cancel free live successors under the
  chain advisory lock, and drains in-flight webhook delivery attempts during
  graceful shutdown before any last-resort cancellation. Round 12 schedules
  recovered rows into the lifecycle-tracked delivery-attempt registry instead
  of awaiting sends inside the recovery worker, adds succeeded-predecessor
  guards to claim, failure-finalize, and repair paths so active successors
  converge after canonical success, and treats response headers as the delivery
  acknowledgement while response-body capture becomes best-effort audit data.
  Round 13 extends the succeeded-predecessor guard into success finalization,
  so an active successor that also receives 2xx is abandoned/superseded with
  its response audit metadata instead of creating a second succeeded row.
  Round 14 broadens the convergence guard from earlier predecessors to any
  succeeded chain peer across claim, success-finalize, and failure-finalize
  paths, and adds `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_succeeded_unique.sql` with a
  partial unique index that structurally enforces one terminal succeeded row
  per retry chain. Round 15
  excludes the current delivery id from succeeded-chain peer checks, requires
  active peer-abandon updates to still target live non-superseded attempts, and
  isolates ordinary stream/client cleanup exceptions after response headers so
  captured acknowledgements still finalize while `CancelledError` propagates.
  Round 16 makes revocation, final-failure, and retry-failure terminal UPDATEs
  require the leased row to still be live (`pending`/`retrying` and not
  superseded), so failure finalization cannot overwrite same-row terminal
  writes that already won. Round 17
  applies the same live-row guard to the success finalize UPDATE, clearing only
  stale lease columns when a same-row terminal write has already won, and
  moves recovery to claim due rows with a lease in the dequeue CTE before
  scheduling send tasks so repeated recovery polls do not enqueue duplicates
  behind the send semaphore. Round 18 sizes each recovery claim batch to the
  send semaphore's current free slots, treats `lease-expired-before-send` as a
  non-consumptive lease release instead of a failed attempt, and makes
  recovery-preclaimed sends take the retry-chain advisory lock for a final
  live-lease and succeeded-peer recheck before any outbound POST. Round 19
  makes external 2xx ACKs trump later lease expiry during success finalization:
  matching token ownership plus a still-live row is enough to persist
  `status='succeeded'`, while failure paths still require lease validity.
  Post-header stream/client cleanup is also bounded so a stuck `__aexit__`
  cannot delay finalization indefinitely. Round 20 moves status-code
  finalization ahead of response-body capture and stream/client cleanup:
  headers first persist `response_status` with `response_body=NULL`, then a
  post-finalize audit update fills the body only if capture finishes within its
  own timeout. Cleanup is also post-finalize best-effort. Round 21 splits the
  successful 2xx terminal UPDATE into its own short committed transaction, then
  reacquires the chain advisory lock for best-effort free-successor cleanup so
  cleanup lock contention, exceptions, or shutdown cancellation cannot roll back
  an already ACKed `status='succeeded'`. It also makes recovery-preclaimed sends
  re-check for live successors, including active-leased successors, under the
  pre-POST chain lock and abandon/supersede the older attempt before any
  duplicate outbound delivery.
  Round 22 keeps the ACK-protecting behavior for ordinary per-successor
  cleanup failures while closing the mixed-version replay window in the common
  case: the success UPDATE now finds and abandons free live successors in the
  same chain-locked transaction, with each abandon isolated by an explicit
  savepoint. A post-commit cleanup pass remains only as a fallback for
  successors inserted after the in-transaction successor query but before the
  success commit.
  Round 23 makes that convergence fully atomic for rolling-upgrade safety:
  per-successor savepoints and the post-commit fallback are removed, so a
  2xx success row and all free successor `status='abandoned'` updates commit
  or roll back together. Cleanup exceptions and `CancelledError` before commit
  now roll back the ACK record and partial cleanup, leaving the lease-owned
  attempt retryable. The rare tradeoff is a bounded duplicate POST after
  lease expiry, logged for observability, instead of a committed succeeded
  predecessor with live successors that old pre-GA workers could replay.
  Round 24 adds
  `db/migrations_v3_5_webhook_succeeded_terminal_trigger.sql`, making
  `status='succeeded'` terminal at the database layer. Old id-only writers
  that attempt to move an ACKed row back to `pending` or `retrying` now fail
  with a trigger-raised `check_violation`, while response-body audit updates
  and lease clearing remain permitted.

### Conflicts and operator handling

- Trigger-raised `MN001` maps to HTTP 409 with reconciliation guidance:
  the branch row is missing, has `NULL head_version_id`, or points to a
  version from another memory. Operators should reconcile
  `memory_branches` against `memory_versions` for that memory before
  retrying the write.

### Deferred after v3.5.0

- Dedicated per-memory deletion-log table and GDPR wipe workflow remain v4
  scope. v3.5.0 keeps the DELETE tombstone snapshot path live in the version
  DAG, but it does not add a separate deletion-log subsystem.

## [3.4.1] — 2026-04-26

Federation schema-compat preflight + dev↔prod MPF restore drill.
Cross-version federation safety is the headline: peers now exchange
schema fingerprints before opening sync, refusing to pair when their
migration sets diverge unless an operator explicitly opts in via
`compat_mode=permissive`. Eight rounds of Codex adversarial review
on the federation handshake (verdict: SHIP). Restore-drill runbook
validated end-to-end on 10k records (~13s, 770 rec/sec) PYTHIA →
PROTEUS.

### Added

- **`GET /v1/federation/schema`** — preflight endpoint returning
  `mnemos_version`, `schema_signature` (`major.minor`), and
  `migrations_fingerprint` (sha256 over filename + content of
  `db/migrations*.sql`). Peers call this before opening sync and
  refuse to pair on mismatch.
- **`federation_peers` columns** — `compat_mode`
  (`strict|permissive`, default `strict`), `peer_mnemos_version`,
  `last_schema_check_at`. `strict` blocks sync on schema mismatch
  with HTTP 409 + operator-action message; `permissive` allows it
  through with a logged warning.
- **Typed exceptions** — `FederationSchemaIncompatible` /
  `Unverifiable` / `Transient` map to HTTP 409 / 409 / 503 so
  peers can distinguish "your schema is wrong" from "I can't
  reach you right now."
- **Native vs federated memory counts in `/stats`** — top-level
  totals plus a per-peer breakdown so operators can see at a
  glance which peer contributed which slice of the catalog.
- **`docs/RESTORE-DRILL.md`** — step-by-step dev↔prod MPF
  round-trip runbook: 5MB body cap on `/v1/import` means the CLI
  tool is the production path; `--preserve-metadata` is the
  dev↔prod lever; three-step DELETE + orphan sweep cleanup
  pattern documented.

### Changed

- **Worker queue ordering changed to next-due-time.** Previous FIFO
  starved peers with shorter `sync_interval_secs` when a longer-
  interval peer queued a large batch. New ORDER BY balances
  fairness across heterogeneous intervals.
- **`FEDERATION_ALLOW_INSECURE` plumbed through staging compose env.**
  Required for cross-version smoke tests on PROTEUS without
  full TLS termination.
- **MORPHEUS / APOLLO S-IVB naming locked** — no rename in v3.4.x.
  Both names appear in code, docs, and ops procedures by design;
  see `docs/PANTHEON.md`.

### Verified

- PROTEUS staging upgraded to v3.4.0, cross-version tested against
  PYTHIA v3.3.0 — `strict` returns 409 with operator-action message;
  `permissive` flip succeeds with 200. FK rollback applied during
  the v3.4 migration audit (issue #1 mnemos-os/mnemos rescoped to
  v3.5).

## [3.4.0] — 2026-04-26

CHARON v0.2 release: full MPF v0.1 sidecar round-trip, plus
staging-deploy infrastructure for PROTEUS as the cross-version
proving ground. Forty-four rounds of Codex adversarial review on the
sidecar attachment paths (cross-tenant attack surface, DAG
poisoning, version-DAG divergence, timestamp-shift, commit-hash
collision, conflict-row equality semantics, snapshot-consistent
export under REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY).

### Added

- **CHARON v0.2 sidecar round-trip** — full MPF v0.1 import + export
  with `--preserve-metadata` flag as the dev↔prod lever. Sidecar
  surfaces: `kg_triples`, `documents`, `facts`, `events`,
  `compression_manifest`, `memory_versions`. Tenant-scoped record
  IDs prevent cross-tenant sidecar attachment. Memory-versions
  sidecar requires root + `preserve_owner=true` (architectural
  restriction). Per-surface hard cap on sidecar export to bound
  memory consumption on large catalogs.
- **`docker-compose.staging.yml`** — PROTEUS staging compose,
  Postgres bound to :5433 (host-Postgres collision avoidance),
  pre-init `mnemos` role for fresh DB initialization.
- **v3.4 planning charters + ops doc** — `docs/V3_5_CHARTER.md`,
  `docs/V3_6_CHARTER.md`, `docs/V4_PLAN.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`,
  `docs/PANTHEON.md` (extended with charter-bound sidecar
  ownership rules), `ROADMAP.md` cut.

### Changed

- **`OLLAMA_EMBED_*` env vars renamed to `INFERENCE_EMBED_*`.**
  Ollama is one of several inference backends; the variable name
  was misleading. Old names not honored — operators must update
  env files on upgrade.
- **GUC scope tightened on branch context.** Branch-scoped GUC now
  set within transaction only, parameterized to prevent injection.
  Same fix cherry-picked to v3.3.0 release as `8058666` (pre-v3.4
  audit).

### Audit

- Forty-four-round Codex adversarial review on sidecar paths.
  Closed: cross-tenant DAG-edge attack, shadow-parent attack,
  memory-ID oracle attack (records-loop), commit_hash collision,
  timestamp-shift, DAG-divergence integrity check, existing-memory
  DAG poisoning, no-main-branch import bypass, stale-version DAG
  poisoning, stale memory_branches not cleared before restore,
  version verification ON CONFLICT exact-match,
  `kg_triples` / `compression_manifest` ON CONFLICT exact-match,
  IS-NOT-DISTINCT-FROM semantics in conflict checks, in-envelope
  parents required for newly-inserted records, freshly-inserted vs
  conflict-skipped UUID tracking, JSON sidecars warn without
  `--preserve-metadata`, root-path conflict-row equality extension,
  conflict-row check covers all envelope-bound columns, pre-insert
  validation rejections block sidecar attachment, gated sidecar
  timestamp tolerance on freshness, COALESCE-tolerance for sidecar
  timestamp retries, snapshot-consistent export via REPEATABLE
  READ READ ONLY.

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-26

Compression-stack settlement, CI policy flip to GitLab, MORPHEUS
slice 2 (real cluster + synthesise), and the EVOLUTION.md origin
narrative. Closes the v3.2 compression-stack open question by
retiring ALETHEIA from the default contest.

### Added

- **MORPHEUS slice 2 — real cluster + synthesise phases.** Phase 1
  foundation shipped in v3.3.0-alpha.1; slice 2 adds the cluster
  pass (semantic grouping over the working set) and the synthesise
  pass (LLM-mediated synthesis of cross-memory patterns into
  derived facts). Three audit-log items closed: namespace scope on
  cluster output, cluster introspection endpoint, FastAPI
  deprecation cleanup. 31 tests in `tests/test_knossos_phase1.py` cover
  the phase-1 tool surface (0.46s).
- **`recall_count` + `last_recalled_at` on memory search hits.**
  Every search result increments the recall counter and updates
  the timestamp. Useful for downstream "warmest" / "coldest"
  prioritization queries.
- **`docs/EVOLUTION.md`** — five-month development timeline from
  v0.1 design review through v3.2 compression-stack settlement.
  Restructured to put origin story in v1.0 section + ADR block
  for release-gate decisions.
- **GitLab CI** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) — three stages (`lint`, `test`,
  `build`) running against real Postgres + pgvector service. See
  `~/.claude/rules/gitlab-ci-policy.md` for the full rationale.
- **GitHub `pr-check.yml`** — slim PR-only lint + unit test
  workflow so external contributors get green/red signal on PR
  without maintainer-side GitLab pre-flight.

### Changed

- **`/kg` and `/sessions` routers moved to `/v1/` prefix.** The
  v2 endpoints stayed in place during the v3.0–3.2 transition;
  v3.3 finishes the migration. Old paths return 410 with the new
  path in the response body.
- **ALETHEIA retired from the default compression stack.** The
  going-forward stack is LETHE + ANAMNESIS + APOLLO (APOLLO in
  v3.3+ per ROADMAP.md Apollo Program). ALETHEIA won 0 contests in
  the 2026-04-23 CERBERUS benchmark — its index-list scoring prompt
  doesn't survive instruction-tuned generalist LLMs, and the
  fallback-to-first-N path is strictly inferior to LETHE at lower
  cost. Niche audit found every case where ALETHEIA might
  theoretically win is owned by LETHE (cheaper), ANAMNESIS (better
  fact shape), or APOLLO (schema-typed). `ALETHEIAEngine` now emits
  a DeprecationWarning on construction and is skipped in the
  default contest (`distillation_worker.py` still honors
  `MNEMOS_ALETHEIA_ENABLED=true` for operators who had it opted in,
  but logs a deprecation warning when that gate flips on). The
  engine class stays importable; v4.0 removes it entirely. See
  `docs/benchmarks/compression-2026-04-23.md` for measured rationale
  and the niche audit captured in-session.

### Removed

- **LETHE / ANAMNESIS / ALETHEIA modules and `CompressionManager`
  removed from the active code path.** Engine classes stay
  importable for backward compatibility; the manager is gone. The
  contest harness instantiates engines directly.

### Fixed

- **`install.py` / `installer/db.py` migration loaders include
  v3.2.2 + v3.3 migrations.** Two newer migration files were
  silently absent from the canonical loader.
- **CI pre-creates `mnemos_user` + `mnemos` roles** before applying
  migrations, eliminating a flaky CI failure mode where migrations
  ran before role provisioning completed.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-04-23

Tenancy + observability + ideation-infrastructure release. Rolls in
the v3.1.1 ops-hardening and v3.1.2 Tier-3 tenancy candidates, adds
the full request-correlation/metrics/tracing/logs observability
stack, wires compression artifacts into the hot retrieval paths,
makes the OpenAI-compatible gateway registry-first, lands per-user
namespace tenancy end-to-end (DB column, auth resolution, admin
provisioning API, Tier 3 enforcement on DAG / entities / webhooks),
ships MPF v0.1 export / import, brings the reasoning layer in line
with the public contract (consensus_response / consensus_score /
winning_muse / cost / latency_ms populated from the engine's own
_compute_consensus output), and opens `/v1/consultations` to
operator-driven Custom Query selection across the refreshed
frontier model registry. Queue workers are now self-healing (stale-
running sweep with forward-progress guarantee) and the GPUGuard
circuit breaker handles auto-replacement safely via a probe-identity
handshake. Closes every HIGH finding from the v3.2 memory-OS audit
and the full follow-up Codex re-audit.

### Ops hardening — v3.1.1 candidate

- **Stranded-running queue recovery sweep**
  (`compression/worker_contest.py`, `distillation_worker.py`). The
  v3.1 contest path had a belt-and-suspenders gap: if the
  fresh-connection mark-failed fallback ALSO failed (pool
  exhausted, SIGKILL mid-txn, host reboot), a queue row sat in
  `running` forever because the dequeue only matched `pending`.
  New `_sweep_stale_running()` runs at the top of every batch,
  reclaiming rows stale longer than
  `MNEMOS_CONTEST_STALE_THRESHOLD_SECS` (default 600). Rows below
  retry ceiling go back to `pending`; rows at ceiling go terminal
  `failed` with `stranded_running: ...` marker.

- **Sweep-vs-late-finisher race defense.** `_process_one` opens its
  persist transaction with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` against
  `memory_compression_queue` and checks both `status='running'` AND
  `attempts == <dequeue-time value>`. If the sweep reclaimed or
  another worker re-dequeued after reset, the fingerprint mismatches
  and the worker bails cleanly — no duplicate audit rows, no
  overwrite. New `race_abandoned` metric counter.

- **GPUGuard single-probe in HALF_OPEN** (`compression/gpu_guard.py`).
  The circuit breaker's HALF_OPEN state admitted every concurrent
  caller as the probe — thundering herd against a possibly-still-
  broken endpoint. Added `_probe_in_flight` coordination so exactly
  one probe is admitted at a time. Subsequent callers fast-fail
  until the probe resolves via `record_success` / `record_failure`.
  Auto-replacement of a wedged probe is intentionally NOT included
  in v3.1.x — avoiding an identity-tracking handshake that would
  have been needed to prevent late-completion races. Operators
  recover a wedged HALF_OPEN via `reset()`.

- **Richer error metadata in candidate manifests**
  (`compression/contest_store.py`). `persist_contest()` now runs
  every non-winner candidate through `_enriched_manifest()`, which
  preserves engine-authored manifest keys and ADDS a namespaced
  `_audit` block: `reject_reason`, `engine_version`, `error`
  (full exception text, previously lost from the DB), `quality_score`
  on floor rejections, `compression_ratio`, `elapsed_ms`, `gpu_used`.
  Winners are not enriched — their typed columns are authoritative.
  Non-dict engine-authored `_audit` values are preserved under
  `_audit_original` rather than crashing persist.

- **Log-space `speed_factor` to stop multiplicative speed dominance**
  (`compression/contest.py`). Raw linear `fastest_ms/elapsed_ms`
  crushed slow-but-accurate engines — a 10x-slower candidate
  scored 0.1 and multiplied through the composite made
  quality_first weighting unable to recover. Now:
  `factor = clamp(1 + log10(ratio)/2, [SPEED_FACTOR_FLOOR=0.1, 1.0])`.
  10x-slower maps to 0.5, 100x-slower bottoms at the floor. This
  is a scoring-breaking change for the `speed_factor` column;
  existing v3.1.0 rows are on a different scale.

- **Scoring-profile validation** (`compression/contest.py`).
  Custom TOML profiles previously accepted any `float()`-able
  value. Negative weights, 1000x weights, `quality_floor >= 1.0`,
  non-numeric strings, and NaN/Inf all produced surprising
  behavior. New `_validated_profile()` clamps weights to
  `[0.0, 10.0]` and `quality_floor` to `[0.0, 0.99]` with loud
  WARNING logs on every clamp. Explicit NaN/Inf rejection
  (they compare False to any numeric bound and would silently
  poison composite scores for every candidate).

- **`docs/SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md`** — per-tier (Server / Workstation
  / Edge) resource floor reference. CPU / RAM / disk / GPU per
  tier, baseline (Python / Postgres / pgvector), environment
  knobs (`MNEMOS_CONTEST_ENABLED`, `MNEMOS_ALETHEIA_ENABLED`,
  `MNEMOS_CONTEST_STALE_THRESHOLD_SECS`), observed resource
  usage from live deployments as sanity check.

### Tier 3 tenancy rollup — v3.1.2 candidate

- **KG triples carry `owner_id` + `namespace`**
  (`db/migrations_v3_1_2_kg_tenancy.sql`, `api/handlers/kg.py`).
  Previously `kg_triples` had no tenancy columns and the `/kg`
  read/mutate paths had NO owner filter at all — every
  authenticated caller saw every row. Added columns idempotently
  (ADD COLUMN without DEFAULT, backfill from linked memory
  rows via `memories.memory_id` join, residual NULLs → 'default',
  THEN SET DEFAULT + NOT NULL — sequencing matters because
  ADD COLUMN DEFAULT would have made the backfill a no-op).
  Handlers now filter on BOTH owner AND namespace for non-root
  callers; cross-tenant `memory_id` references on create are
  rejected 404 (not 403 — existence is invisible to non-owners).

- **App-layer namespace enforcement on `list_memories` and
  `get_memory`** (`api/handlers/memories.py`). RLS policies from
  v1_multiuser scope `owner_id` + `group_id` but never filter by
  `namespace`. Personal-mode installs with RLS disabled had no
  tenancy filter at all. Non-root callers now get
  `AND namespace = user.namespace` appended to every WHERE
  branch (combined with category/subcategory filters). Root
  bypasses.

- **Owner + namespace pinning on `/memories/search` and
  `/memories/rehydrate`** (`api/handlers/memories.py`,
  `api/lifecycle.py`). `_fts_fetch` and `_vector_search` gained
  an `owner_id` kwarg. Non-root searches force `owner_id =
  user.user_id` and `namespace = user.namespace` regardless of
  the request body. Cross-namespace request from non-root →
  HTTP 403 (explicit rejection rather than silent narrowing).
  Cache key now hashes the EFFECTIVE pinned values, not the
  raw request.

- **Namespace enforcement on mutation precheck paths**
  (`api/handlers/memories.py`). `update_memory`,
  `delete_memory`, and `get_compression_manifests` now check
  BOTH owner AND namespace for non-root callers.

- **Registry-backed `/v1/models`** (`api/handlers/openai_compat.py`).
  Replaces the hardcoded six-entry list with
  `SELECT … FROM model_registry WHERE available AND NOT deprecated
  ORDER BY graeae_weight DESC`. This originally retained a built-in
  fallback list and synthetic `owned_by="Unknown"` detail responses for
  unregistered IDs; v3.5 Slice 8 supersedes that behavior with
  registry-only discovery and 404 on unknown model detail lookup.

### Provider routing + audit fixes — handoff work

- **Provider-unavailability errors now explain the cause**
  (`graeae/engine.py`, `api/handlers/openai_compat.py`).
  `_unavailable()` gained an `error: str` field; `route()` populates
  it for each failure class (provider not registered, missing
  api_key, upstream exception). `/v1/chat/completions` surfaces
  the cause in the 503 detail so operators don't have to tail
  debug logs:
  ```
  HTTP 503 {"detail": "Provider anthropic unavailable: HTTP 401 Unauthorized"}
  ```
  Missing-key case is caught pre-dispatch with a targeted hint
  at the standard env var to set.

- **MNEMOS-native Provider Registry File + env-var fallback**
  (`graeae/api_keys.py`). The key-file loader was too rigid and
  too permissive in the wrong ways: it only accepted the canonical
  `{"llm_providers": {...}}` shape AND logged only a generic
  warning on missing files. Replaced with:
  - Canonical shape only (MNEMOS-owned format, self-contained,
    no symlinks to third-party service key files).
  - Per-provider environment variable fallback using standard
    names every vendor SDK uses — `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`,
    `GROQ_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`,
    `NVIDIA_API_KEY`. Env vars win when both are set.
  - Search-path order swapped so `~/.config/mnemos/api_keys.json`
    is preferred over the legacy `~/.api_keys_master.json`.
  - `load_api_keys()` → `load_provider_registry()` with a
    backward-compat alias.

- **Refreshed frontier model defaults** (`graeae/engine.py`,
  `api/handlers/openai_compat.py`). v3.1.0 shipped with 2024-era
  model IDs. Updated to current:
  - `openai: gpt-4o → gpt-5.2-chat-latest`
  - `claude: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 → claude-opus-4-6`
  - `gemini: gemini-1.5-pro → gemini-3-pro-preview` (URL too)
  - `xai: grok-2-latest → grok-4-1-fast`
  - `perplexity: sonar-pro` (unchanged)
  - `groq: llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (unchanged)

  GPT-5 series requires `temperature=1` (returns 400 on any other
  value). `_query_openai_compatible` now omits the temperature
  field for `gpt-5*` models, matching the existing
  `max_completion_tokens` branching.

- **`graeae_audit_log` schema backfill**
  (`db/migrations_v3_1_2_audit_log_columns.sql`). Databases that
  applied `migrations_v2_versioning.sql` first got the v2 table
  shape; `migrations_v3_graeae_unified.sql` used `CREATE TABLE IF
  NOT EXISTS` so the six new columns (`prompt`, `response_text`,
  `prev_chain_hash`, `model`, `latency_ms`, `cost_usd`) never
  landed. The consultations handler INSERT referenced these by
  name, so `/v1/consultations` returned 503 with "audit trail
  is required" and an `UndefinedColumnError` in the log.
  Added all six via `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`.
  All nullable so existing hash-only audit rows aren't
  retroactively invalidated.

- **UUID → str coercion on consultation response**
  (`api/handlers/consultations.py`). asyncpg returns UUID columns
  as `uuid.UUID` objects; `ConsultationResponse.consultation_id`
  is typed `Optional[str]` and pydantic strict mode rejected the
  UUID. One-line coercion at the construction site.

### Tests

Suite: 282 → 295 → 303 → 309 → 317 → 318 → 318 across the series.
All targeted tests green, full suite 0 regressions.

### Deferred to later releases (v3.3+)

- Horizontal scaling past workers=1 — GRAEAE reliability state
  (circuit breaker, rate limiter, semaphores) is process-local, so
  the server is still pinned to single-worker uvicorn. External
  state store (Redis) or session-affinity at the load balancer is
  the path forward.
- Webhook SSRF DNS-rebinding defense — the current allowlist is
  checked once at subscribe time; a malicious DNS TTL could still
  flip to an internal IP between check and delivery. Needs
  per-delivery re-resolution against a pinned IP.
- Federation peer tokens stored plaintext — `federation.py:113`
  still writes tokens in the clear; needs symmetric-encrypt-at-rest
  with operator-supplied key or KMS plugin.
- APOLLO engine (v3.2–v3.4 per ROADMAP.md) — schema-aware dense
  encoding for LLM-to-LLM wire use. S-IC scheduled for v3.3 kickoff.
- Dream state (v3.3 preview / v3.4 real) — divergent-mode ideation
  riding on APOLLO's dense-form substrate. Design scoped in
  `docs/DREAM_STATE_DESIGN.md`.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-23

Compression platform release. Adds a plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC open
to operator-registered engines, a competitive per-memory contest across
three built-in engines, and a persisted audit log recording every
winner AND loser per contest with its score and disqualification
reason — not just the chosen output. Extends the v3.0 schema with three
new tables (`memory_compression_queue`, `memory_compression_candidates`,
`memory_compressed_variants`) wired through a GPU circuit breaker that
fast-fails when the inference endpoint is unreachable.

Ships the Tier 1 small-fix unblocks already on master since 2026-04-22
under the v3.1 umbrella; Tier 3 tenancy fixes are explicitly deferred
to v3.1.1; APOLLO (the fourth engine, schema-aware dense encoding for
LLM-to-LLM wire use) is staged across v3.2–v3.4 per `ROADMAP.md`.

### Added

- **Plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC** (`compression/base.py`). Open
  interface for first-party and operator-registered engines. Declares
  `id`, `label`, `version`, `gpu_intent` at class level. One async
  method, `compress(CompressionRequest) -> CompressionResult`. Adapted
  from OpenClaw's `CompactionProvider` pattern (Apache-2.0, credited in
  module docstring).

- **Three engines under the ABC**: LETHEEngine (extractive, CPU),
  ALETHEIAEngine (LLM-assisted token importance, GPU), ANAMNESISEngine
  (LLM fact extraction, GPU). All three compose the existing v3.0
  engines; existing sync callers (manager.py, distillation_engine.py)
  continue to work unchanged.

- **Competitive-selection contest** (`compression/contest.py`). The
  distillation worker runs every eligible engine per memory via
  `asyncio.gather`, scores each candidate via a composite function
  (`quality * ratio_term * speed_factor`, with a quality floor that
  disqualifies damaged output), and picks the highest-scoring survivor.
  Scoring profile configurable via `~/.mnemos/compression_scoring.toml`:
  `balanced` | `quality_first` | `speed_first` | `custom`.

- **Persisted contest audit log** (`compression/contest_store.py`).
  `persist_contest()` writes every candidate (winner AND losers)
  into `memory_compression_candidates` and upserts the winner into
  `memory_compressed_variants` in a single transaction. Operators
  get a full record of what was tried, what scored how, and why each
  engine was or wasn't picked.

- **GPU circuit breaker** (`compression/gpu_guard.py`). Per-endpoint
  three-state breaker (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED) tracks
  health of each configured `GPU_PROVIDER_HOST`. `gpu_required`
  engines (ALETHEIA, ANAMNESIS) fast-fail with
  `reject_reason='disabled'` when the circuit is open instead of
  piling doomed requests onto a dead endpoint. Process-local
  registry (v3.2 horizontal-scaling work makes it shared-state).

- **Distillation-worker queue drain** (`compression/worker_contest.py`
  + `distillation_worker.py`). `process_contest_queue()` atomically
  dequeues pending rows via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, runs the
  contest, persists the outcome, transitions the queue row
  `pending → running → done/failed` with an honest rejection-reason
  summary on failure. Runs alongside the existing v3.0 direct-memory
  polling loop; failure-isolated so a contest error doesn't stall
  the legacy path.

- **`GET /v1/memories/{id}/compression-manifests`** endpoint
  (`api/handlers/memories.py`). Returns the current winning variant
  and every historical contest grouped by `contest_id`, with
  scoring fields and reject_reason per engine attempt.
  `?include_content=true` returns full compressed content; default
  is a 200-char preview. RLS-gated via the underlying memories
  table.

- **v3.1 schema** (`db/migrations_v3_1_compression.sql`). Three new
  tables wired idempotently: `memory_compression_queue` (write-time
  task queue), `memory_compression_candidates` (full contest log),
  `memory_compressed_variants` (current winner per memory). Dry-run
  validated against real Postgres.

- **Environment flags**:
  - `MNEMOS_CONTEST_ENABLED` (default `true`) — gates the whole v3.1
    path. Operators who want to run v3.0 behavior exclusively can
    flip to `false`.
  - `MNEMOS_ALETHEIA_ENABLED` (default `false`) — see "Changed"
    below.
  - `MNEMOS_CONTEST_MIN_CONTENT_LENGTH` (default `0` = off) —
    optional threshold below which the worker marks queue rows
    `failed` with `error='too_short'` before running any engine.
    Surfaced by the 2026-04-23 benchmark: ~8% of real production
    memories are short templated blurbs (git commit headers,
    consultation stubs) that cannot be meaningfully compressed under
    any engine at the balanced profile's floor — LETHE returns
    ratio~1.0, ANAMNESIS's rendering inflates past 1.0, contest
    fails "no winner" after burning ANAMNESIS's multi-second GPU
    round-trip. Recommended value `500` for GPU-constrained installs;
    default `0` preserves the full-contest behavior.

- **Admin compression-queue endpoints** (`api/handlers/admin.py`):
  - `POST /admin/compression/enqueue` — enqueue specific memory IDs
    into `memory_compression_queue`. Skips unknown IDs silently
    (reports count in response).
  - `POST /admin/compression/enqueue-all` — bulk enqueue up to
    `limit` (default 500, max 10,000) memories. Default filters to
    memories without an existing variant; `only_uncompressed=false`
    forces re-contest.
  Without these, the v3.1 contest pipeline has no application-layer
  entry point — operators would need manual SQL to exercise it.

- **First real benchmark**:
  `docs/benchmarks/compression-2026-04-23.md`. 464 stratified memories
  from PYTHIA MNEMOS (uncompressed only, small/medium/large buckets)
  drained through the contest on a CERBERUS test deployment with
  gemma-4-E4B-it-Q6_K as the judge model. Winner distribution,
  per-category breakdown, ratio histogram, timing histogram per
  engine, outlier cases, and the one real bug the drain surfaced
  and fixed.

- **`ROADMAP.md`**. Committed scope for v3.1 and the v3.2–v3.4
  "Apollo Program" staged rollout. Explicit deferrals with
  rationale.

### Changed

- **ALETHEIA is disabled by default** (`MNEMOS_ALETHEIA_ENABLED=false`).
  The v3.0 engine's index-list scoring prompt ("output comma-separated
  token indices to keep") doesn't survive instruction-tuned chat
  models — tested against Qwen2.5-Coder-7B and gemma-4-E4B-it, both
  return off-spec text the parser can't interpret. Parser falls
  through to first-N truncation with honest `quality_score=0.60`,
  which the balanced profile's 0.70 quality_floor correctly rejects.
  Engine never wins and burns GPU time. Default engine roster is now
  LETHE + ANAMNESIS. Operators with a tuned prompt/model combination
  opt in via the env var. The prompt redesign is v3.x scope.

- **README.md + ROADMAP.md reality-alignment audit**. Stripped APOLLO
  from v3.1 descriptions (moved to v3.2–v3.4). Switched "four engines"
  → "three engines under a plugin ABC". Normalized stale v3.0.0
  language to v3.0 (release line). Removed "on the roadmap" claims
  for integration adapters not actually in the roadmap. Generalized
  specific production-count numbers that would age.

### Fixed

- **Tier 1 unblocks** (already on master as 2026-04-22 commits, now
  under the v3.1 umbrella):
  - MCP stdio server path prefix (`#M31-01`). The published stdio
    MCP server called `/memories*` but the REST router registers
    `/v1/memories*` — nine of fourteen memory tools returned 404
    against a default install.
  - Installer `api_keys` schema alignment (`#M31-04`). Fresh
    auth-enabled installs failed at seed because `installer/db.py`
    wrote columns the current schema no longer has.
  - Admin `create_user` accepts `role='federation'` (`#M31-03`).
    Federation peer onboarding previously required direct SQL writes
    because the admin validator and the v1_multiuser CHECK
    constraint both rejected the role at creation time.

- **`mnemos_version_snapshot()` trigger bytea crash on backslash
  content** (`db/migrations_v3_1_versioning_fix.sql`). The v2
  versioning trigger computed `commit_hash` via direct `text::bytea`
  cast on concatenated memory content. Postgres interprets
  backslash-escape sequences (`\x47`, `\d+`, `\0`, `\n`, `\x1b[...`)
  as bytea escape syntax and rejects the INSERT outright with
  "invalid input syntax for type bytea". Affected any production
  install ingesting memories that contain code, paths, or regex
  patterns — which is most real content. Latent since v2 shipped;
  surfaced by the v3.1 CERBERUS test deployment running real PYTHIA
  memories. Fix replaces `(text)::bytea` with `convert_to(text,
  'UTF8')` which returns raw UTF-8 bytes without trying to parse
  escape sequences. Idempotent migration; `CREATE OR REPLACE
  FUNCTION` replaces the existing definition in place.

- **Composite-zero winner CHECK-constraint violation**
  (`compression/contest.py`). Short memories where every engine
  scored `composite_score=0` (ratio at or below MIN_CHUNK_RATIO
  or >= 1.0) previously "won" the contest with
  `persist_contest`'s NULL coercion violating
  `mcc_winner_has_output`. Surfaced during the 49-memory CERBERUS
  drain. `run_contest` now requires `composite_score > 0` for
  winner eligibility; zero-composite survivors fall through to
  `reject_reason='inferior'`, and the queue row is marked `failed`
  with an honest "no winner" message rather than silently storing a
  degenerate "winner" variant.

- **ALETHEIA parser returns first-N fallback on unparseable model
  responses** (`compression/aletheia.py`). Pre-existing v3.0 bug
  where the importance-score parser returned empty content when
  zero valid indices survived filtering (as opposed to an actual
  exception). Now explicitly raises on empty-indices → existing
  first-N fallback fires. Compress result reports honest
  `quality_score=0.60` and `method='aletheia_parse_fallback'` when
  fallback is used. Surfaced during live-GPU testing against Qwen
  and gemma; the contest correctly filters the degenerate output
  via the ratio_term floor, but the audit log now accurately shows
  WHAT happened rather than reporting "aletheia" with empty content.

- **`ratio_term` floor below MIN_CHUNK_RATIO** (`compression/contest.py`).
  Scoring function returned `1.0 - ratio` for any ratio, which
  rewarded degenerate empty-output engines (ratio=0) with maximum
  score. Now returns 0 for ratios below `MIN_CHUNK_RATIO` (0.15) or
  at/above 1.0 — empty output and non-compression both score zero.
  Surfaced by live-GPU testing of ALETHEIA.

### Deferred

- **Tier 3 tenancy fixes** — v3.1.1 patch series with migration
  guides and per-fix regression coverage. Covers KG `owner_id`
  column + handler enforcement, namespace enforcement on memory
  paths, application-layer owner filter (defense-in-depth beside
  RLS), and registry-backed `/v1/models` (instead of hardcoded list).
- **APOLLO engine + schema-aware dense encoding** — v3.2–v3.4
  Saturn V-staged rollout per `ROADMAP.md`. Design informed by
  InvestorClaw's consultative-LLM pipeline pattern, not by raw
  Apollo-era telemetry specs.
- **Narration endpoint** (`GET /v1/memories/{id}/narrate`) — v3.2,
  APOLLO's companion read path.
- **Hot-path compression-variant reads** (rehydrate / gateway inject
  / session context serving winner variants instead of raw
  `memories.content`) — v3.2 alongside APOLLO.
- **Judge-LLM quality scoring** replacing engine self-reports —
  v3.2 alongside APOLLO. Today's scoring depends on engines'
  self-reported quality; a real judge would likely shift some
  wins between engines.

## [3.0.1] — 2026-04-22

Patch release fixing three credibility-sensitive defects in the initial
public cut of v3.0.0. No feature changes, no schema changes, safe in-place
upgrade.

### Fixed

- **OpenAI gateway: full conversation history reaches the provider**
  (`api/handlers/openai_compat.py`). The `_route_to_provider` helper used
  by `/v1/chat/completions` and `/sessions/*/messages` previously
  collapsed the request to `messages[-1]["content"]`, silently dropping
  the system prompt, injected memory context, and every prior assistant
  turn before the provider call. A new `_flatten_messages_for_prompt`
  helper serializes the full `messages` array with role boundaries so
  multi-turn chat and session history reach the provider intact. Silent
  regression — no error, just degraded responses — fixed.

- **Docker Compose applies all 11 migrations, not 4**
  (`docker-compose.yml`). The v3.0 Compose file mounted only the first
  four migration files into `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. Fresh Compose
  installs booted without sessions, DAG, consultations audit, webhooks,
  OAuth, federation, or ownership tables — every v3 route 500'd on first
  use. All eleven migration files are now mounted in the canonical
  order (matches `installer/db.py::run_migrations()`).

- **Session compression metrics tightened** (`api/handlers/sessions.py`).
  The session-injection path currently ships raw-slice truncation, not
  real compression; the `compression_ratio` columns on
  `session_messages` and `session_memory_injections` now write `NULL`
  rather than placeholder constants. Real ratios are populated in v3.1
  once compression is wired into the session path.

### Also

- Internal renaming: compression mode aliases in `compression/lethe.py`
  and `compression/distillation_engine.py` updated to accurate
  descriptors. No behavior change; source-tree honesty pass.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-22

First public release.

MNEMOS has been in daily production use since December 2025, backing multiple
active agentic systems. This is the first cut shipped as open source — a
single unified FastAPI service covering memory, multi-LLM consensus
reasoning, DAG versioning, provider routing, and an OpenAI-compatible
gateway.

### What's in

**Unified API under `/v1/*`**

- **Consultations** (`/v1/consultations`) — GRAEAE multi-LLM consensus
  reasoning with cited memory artifacts and a tamper-evident SHA-256
  hash-chained audit log. Memory-injection tracking per consultation via
  `consultation_memory_refs`. Atomic persistence: consultation row, audit
  entry, and memory refs commit in a single transaction; audit-write
  failure aborts the consultation.
- **Memories** (`/v1/memories`) — CRUD, semantic + FTS search, DAG
  versioning (git-like: `log`, `branch`, `merge`, `revert`), three-tier
  compression pipeline (LETHE CPU / ALETHEIA GPU / ANAMNESIS archival)
  with a written quality manifest on every transformation.
- **Providers** (`/v1/providers`) — unified catalog, health tracking,
  task-aware model recommendation. Falls back to static config when the
  model-registry table is empty (fresh-install friendly).
- **OpenAI-compatible gateway** (`POST /v1/chat/completions`,
  `GET /v1/models`) — drop-in for OpenAI SDK consumers with automatic
  provider routing and optional memory injection.
- **Sessions** (`/sessions`) — stateful multi-turn chat with memory
  injection at turn boundaries.
- **Webhooks** (`/v1/webhooks`) — HMAC-SHA256-signed outbound event
  delivery. SSRF-hardened URL validation at both subscription and
  dispatch time (loopback, private, link-local, cloud-metadata endpoints
  all rejected). Durable retry log replayed on restart (1m / 5m / 30m /
  2h backoff; `abandoned` after four attempts).
- **OAuth / OIDC** (`/auth/oauth/*`) — browser login via Google, GitHub,
  Azure AD, or any generic OIDC provider (Keycloak, Authentik, Auth0,
  Okta). DB-backed sessions, hourly GC, `email_verified` required for
  cross-provider account linking. Coexists with API-key Bearer auth.
- **Federation** (`/v1/federation/*`) — pull-based cross-instance memory
  sync. Per-memory opt-in via `permission_mode` (others-read bit).
  Admin-only peer management, `federation`-role `/feed` endpoint,
  loop-prevention via `federation_source`.
- **Knowledge graph** (`/kg/triples`, `/kg/timeline/{subject}`) —
  temporal triple store with `valid_from` / `valid_until` windows.
- **Per-owner multi-tenant isolation** on memories, consultations,
  state, journal, entities. Root-only override for cross-owner
  operations.

**Infrastructure and tooling**

- Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL + pgvector, asyncpg.
- Body size limit enforced as streaming ASGI middleware (chunked-upload
  safe, default 5 MB, `MAX_BODY_BYTES` configurable).
- Rate limiter keyed on socket peer by default; honours `X-Forwarded-For`
  when `RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_PROXY=true`.
- Distillation worker supervised with exponential-backoff restart
  (cap 5 min).
- TLS enforced on federation peer URLs (opt-out via
  `FEDERATION_ALLOW_INSECURE`).
- CI runs under `uv` with a reproducible `.venv`. Ruff-clean tree.
- Installer CLI (`mnemos-install`) shipped as a `[project.scripts]`
  entry point so `pip install mnemos-os` gives you a working install
  binary without needing the source tree.
- All eleven SQL migrations ride inside the wheel as `db/*.sql`
  package data — accessible at runtime via
  `importlib.resources.files("db")`.

**Integrations**

- Drop-in hooks, skills, and MCP configs for Claude Code, OpenClaw,
  ZeroClaw, and Hermes. Each framework gets SKILL.md + MCP config +
  enforcement snippet; Claude Code also includes idempotent install /
  uninstall scripts.
- IBM Docling integration for PDF / DOCX / HTML / MD / PPTX / TXT
  import (`tools/docling_import.py`).
- Generic bulk-import helper (`tools/memory_import.py`).
- MCP tools for DAG versioning and the model optimizer (stdio MCP server).

### Security posture

- Tamper-evident SHA-256 hash chain on every consultation.
  `audit/verify` walks the chain from genesis; rate-limited 5/min,
  `audit` list 30/min.
- Consultation row + audit entry + memory refs commit atomically.
  Audit-write failure aborts the consultation with 503.
- Webhook URL validation blocks loopback, RFC1918 private, link-local,
  multicast, reserved, cloud-metadata endpoints (Google / AWS / Azure /
  Alibaba / Tencent / IPv6 variants). Async DNS resolution so a slow
  resolver can't freeze the ASGI worker.
- Webhook payloads HMAC-SHA256 signed per subscription. Delivery log
  retained after soft-delete for audit.
- OAuth cookie `Secure` flag honours `X-Forwarded-Proto` behind a
  trusted proxy (`OAUTH_TRUST_PROXY=true`). Sessions DB-backed,
  revocable.
- OAuth account-linking requires `email_verified=true` from the
  provider (strict — the string `"false"` does not count as verified).
- DAG merge wrapped in a single transaction held under
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` keyed on `(memory_id, target_branch)` so
  concurrent merges cannot produce orphan commits or duplicate version
  numbers.
- Memory `owner_id` / `namespace` override on create requires
  `role='root'`.
- Explicit `owner_id = $2` filter on memory PATCH / DELETE as
  defense-in-depth beyond RLS.
